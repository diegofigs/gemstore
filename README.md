#Gemstore Web Application


##About

The gemstore web application is a basic CRUD app inspired by **[CodeSchool](https://www.codeschool.com/)** and itâ€™s AngularJS course. This is my final Data Structures project and is heavily modified from the original web application.

##Requirements

As part of the assignment, we had to meet specific requirements:
* Implement Java Play REST server that feeds AngularJS app its gems.
* Underlying container structure had to be a Sorted Circular Doubly Linked List.
* REST server had to be able to perform CRUD operations.
* __Bonus__: Redesign or at least change some of the styling.
* __Bonus__: Deploy on Heroku platform.

##Implementation

* Backend made in **[Java Play Framework](https://www.playframework.com/)** and Java.
* Frontend made using **[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)** and **[Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)**.
